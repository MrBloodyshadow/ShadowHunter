# ShadowHunter

This bot was made for a request post on https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestABot/5x2yuo.

Original request:

I submit a lot of spammers to /r/spam - these accounts are then reviewed by the admins and usually shadowbanned.
Sometimes I like to look at my submission history to rediscover cool stuff but nowadays I can't do that because so much of it is just dead spam submissions.
I would like a bot that can delete these posts from my history, or at least generate links to the submissions where the user has been deleted (so the page looks like this and the link the bot generates would look like this)
If it could create a separate table with links to posts where the user has not been banned so I can request a re-review, that would also be helpful.
Thanks in advance
